## What will be implemented

- From a list: implement "see more", search, and sort
- File Upload: either via 1. manually upload folder + create thumbnail using node.js library, OR 2. use AWS S3 bucket to upload files and use AWS Lambda to make a function; a functional program to create thumbnail and store the uploaded files into the S3 bucket
- Downsize the uploaded image file by creating a thumbnail with a much smaller size (to control traffic size)
- Create routes using outlet
- Create a slider (not using swiper js so slides on button click, does not have on touch swipe)
